#Simple Swing  

Simple swing is a simplefied version of Swing for Java. 

It was created to help memebers of my school class gain access to GUI in java without having to learn the whole Swing library.
I have plans to continue working on adding more components of the Java Swing library as to further simplify Swing to where even the most basic programmer can use it.
